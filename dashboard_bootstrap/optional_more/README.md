This repository starts out with the following three files:
- dashboard.css
- dashboard.js
- index.html

They are from the Dashboard example that comes with Bootstrap 5, with minor changes to pull resources from cdn.

Only minimual changes are made to these files so that we can easily upgrade to future versions of the example.

Thus all app-specific changes are made in subfolders.

todo:
framework:
	add a way to disable the existing contents and replace with "hello world" content.
ado:
	azure devops auth and sample.
